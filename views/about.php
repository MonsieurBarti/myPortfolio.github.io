          <p>
            I'm 20 and I'm studying IT in France. I've been building Websites
            and learning english for 2 years now. I really enjoy to make
            Websites using JS and SASS. I'm currently learning Vue.JS and
            Laravel/Symfony to be able to be a fullstack Web developer.

          <h3>Apithanos</h3>
          <h6>Video Game Website</h6>
          <p>
            I made this Website for a project that I had last year. The purpose
            of the project was to make a video game using Unity. It was a really
            nice 6 months project. I learned to work in team and it was overall
            a great Experience. This website is kind of bad compared to what I
            can do now but it's still one of my first real project.

          <p>
            My third real project is this portfolio you are looking at right
            now. I'm kind of proud of this work and I think that it is really
            good looking and easy to use. Feel free to contact me to let me know
            what you think of it. You might be wondering what my second project
            was ... It was a fullstack Website for a client using php.

          <h3>CVCreator</h3>
          <h6>Fullstack Developer</h6>
          <p>
            This project is really special to me. It's a project I'm still
            working on. It was ordered by <a href="">Maxence Morin</a> because
            he had difficulties making a nice looking CV. So he asked me and
            three of my friends to make him a
            <span class="text-secondary">CVCreator</span> website. So, that's
            what we are all doing during our free time. This website is builded
            with ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS for the Backend. Our
            database is MongoDB. We are using a few frameworks such as VueJS and
            ExpressJS.
